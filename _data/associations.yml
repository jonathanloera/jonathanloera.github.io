  summary: I work as a volunteer at the Minnesota State Fair. My job was to work at the ticket stand and make sure everyone who came thru had a stamp. It helped me develop more communication skills as I was talking to hundreds of people a day.

  summary: I was in NHS for most of my high school and did a lot of volunteering jobs. This was my first experience with starting to work and helped me develop a good work ethic and being time organized as I had to balance real work, school, and volunteering.
