    My resource directory is a paper I created that contains 30 different
    resources that are intended help the community I would serve. Resources I
    have are, local shelters, food shelfs, free clinics, employment services
    and more. I did my research on the western Wisconsin area, as I'm
    interested in working in this area; And this directory would be useful if I
    encounter an individual who needs help.

# Rehabilitation of Public Offenders

    Choose a real life example of a criminal offense and created my own
    rehabilitation program to see if the offender can be rehabilitated. The
    case I choose was Chris Watts v. Colorado where Mr. Watts committed three
    accounts of first degree murder. Throughout my research to create my
    rehabilitation program, I found that there is no concrete rehabilitation
    programs in place for offenders who have committed murder. I then created a
    program using existing tools and services that could have success with the
    rehabilitation of convicted murders.


# Pre-Practicum
- project: Juvenile Detention Effects on the Youth
  role:
  duration: 2021
  # url: "#"
  description: >
    Researched into Juvenile Detention Center (JDC) to see the different
    aspects of how juveniles mental health, their education, and risk of being
    a victim of violence/abuse is effected. Now in days juvenile courts are now
    sentencing juveniles to rehabilitation programs rather than a JDC; Which is
    a good thing to see change when having data to show that JDC has not been
    the most effective.
