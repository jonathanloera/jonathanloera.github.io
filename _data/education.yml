  summary: >
    I've taken meaningful classes where I've learned different aspects of
    criminal officers as in theories of crime and why people commit crime,
    studying treatment services that are available for adolescents, strategies
    to prevent abuse, and learned about rehab services offered in correction
    facilities. With this knowledge, I've addressed real world examples and
    created my own rehab service programs for different types of offenders from
    what I've learned in class.
